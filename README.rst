Alibaba Cloud Python SDK 2.0
============================

|Build Status| |Version| |Gitter|


Alibaba Cloud Python SDK 2.0 is aimed to provide a Pythonic, object-oriented interface of Alibaba
Cloud APIs. Now it's still under development, with a few ECS functions and resources available. By
using it, developers can make use of ECS APIs to manage resources including instances, with a
much better programming experience than the current
`aliyun-openapi-python-sdk <https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-openapi-python-sdk>`.

The SDK supports Python 3.6 and will support more Python versions in the near future.

Installation
==============

.. code-block:: console
    $ pip install alibaba-cloud-python-sdk-v2

If you prefer installing the SDK from source:

    $ git clone git://github.com/aliyun/alibabacloud-python-sdk-v2.git
